# 📘 Basics Before DSA – Java Foundations

This folder contains the **basic and foundational programs of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**.  
The goal of this section is to build **strong problem-solving fundamentals** before moving on to advanced DSA topics.

All programs in this folder are part of the **initial phase of DSA preparation** and follow the learning path of **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet (Basics Section)**.

## ✅ Topics Covered in This Folder

### 🔹 Core Java Basics

- Data types and type casting
- Input and output using `Scanner`
- Functions and method calls
- Control flow statements (`if-else`, `switch-case`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

---

### 🔹 Basic Maths

- Count digits in a number
- Reverse a number

---

### 🔹 Arrays

- Find minimum and maximum element
- Find second largest element (optimized approach)
- Sum of array elements
- Count even and odd numbers
- Taking array input and displaying output

---

### 🔹 Pattern Problems

- Square and triangle patterns
- Number-based patterns
- Pyramid and inverted pyramid patterns
- Combined star patterns

---

### 🔹 Strings

- Basic string operations
- Character access and traversal
- Case conversion
- String manipulation using character arrays

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Improve logical thinking through pattern problems
- Understand time and space complexity at a basic level
- Prepare a solid base for advanced DSA topics
